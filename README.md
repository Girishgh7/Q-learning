## 🚖 Taxi-v3 Q-Learning

This repository contains a Q-learning implementation for the Taxi-v3 environment from OpenAI's Gym. The goal is to train an agent to pick up and drop off passengers at the correct locations on a 5x5 grid.

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Gym

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib gym
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Q-learning.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Q-learning
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
python Q_learning.py
```

## 📝 Code Explanation

The script follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Import necessary libraries and initialize the environment.
2. **Q-Table Setup**: Create a Q-table with zeros.
3. **Action Selection**: Use an epsilon-greedy policy to choose actions.
4. **Q-Table Update**: Update the Q-values based on the agent's experience.
5. **Epsilon Decay**: Gradually reduce the exploration rate.
6. **Rendering**: Visualize the agent's performance after training.

## 📊 Results

After training, the agent should be able to efficiently navigate the grid and complete the tasks. The script also includes a rendering section to visualize the agent's performance.
